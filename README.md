# Team Vision: Project Phase 3

## Overview
Our project is a web application for organizing communities. Our vision
is to combine the features of a home webpage with those of a shared
online calendar. The goal is to allow groups of people - whether they
be friend groups, clubs, or organizations - to have an easy-to-use tool
for organizing events.

This project was developed for [CS 497S: Scalable Web Systems][1], taught by Professor Tim Richards at UMass Amherst in Fall 2020.
